README for html strainer

Html Strainer is my attempt at creating a script to remove unwanted attributes and tags from legacy (or just foreign) html code.

How to use it.
==============

Copy the html you want to clean into the input.html file. Then fire up a terminal and run the script by typing:
'python html_strainer.py'

The cleaned html will appear in output.html for you to do what you want with it.

Notes
=====
1. It's currently only compatible with python 2.
2. Future versions will allow you to specify input and output files via commandline arguments. I just didn't have the time or knowledge to write this into the first version.
